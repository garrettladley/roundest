## What is this?

After watching [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg)'s and [Ben](https://www.youtube.com/@bmdavis419)'s [1 App, 5 Stacks Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-EWIlZW0mM), I wanted to build the same app in my favorite stack. That being the GoFTTH Stack, let's just call it GOTH. It includes, Go, Fiber, Templ, TailwindCSS, and HTMX.
